"""Deterministic instant-feedback beats for the app-driven drill walk.

The app owns the tree walk and posts a drill event (started / solved / wrong / new_line /
finished); the MCP turns that event into the matching feedback beat and pushes it on the beats
channel. So the app stays a pure renderer, the feedback text lives in ONE place, and — crucially —
it is never authored by the LLM, so it can't hallucinate (generic, no board claims). The coach's
*grounded* WHY still comes separately, on demand, via `push_beat`.

`started` produces no beat — the coach sets the scene. Every other event does.

Moved in from `lucena-backend/grounding_tools` 2026-07-22, alongside `drill.py`
(its only importer).
