"""Grounded hint-ladder derivation (coach-contract "Socratic core").

A probe beat carries a `hints` ladder — 2–3 nudges ordered vague → specific,
none of which states the answer. The danger is an LLM *inventing* those nudges
(the exact confident-wrong failure the fact sheet exists to kill). So the ladder
is derived here, server-side, from grounded truth: the engine's own principal
variation plus the board core's attacker geometry. Every rung is a partial
reveal of the winning line — **true by construction**, because the PV is already
the best line and the geometry is computed, not guessed. The LLM only phrases
what this returns; it never adds a fact.

Scope: the ladder grounds a *tactic* — a fork / king-hunt (a mover move whose
piece attacks two-plus targets at once, or a check that wins a piece), or a
direct material-winning capture. When the line has no such handle (quiet /
positional best moves), `derive_hints` returns `[]` and the coach falls back to
a mastery-tiered question rather than a fabricated hint. Board-core only besides
the engine PV it is handed — GPL hygiene holds (LLD §2.0).
