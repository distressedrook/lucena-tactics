"""Server-side drill walk. The MCP owns the forcing-win tree and adjudicates every move: the app
just pushes the raw move; the server decides correct/wrong, advances the board, plays the
opponent's reply, and returns the side effects (board / feedback beat / drill event) to push. So
the app is a pure renderer and the coach reads real move context.

Ported from the app-side walker (the debugged logic): a solve node has one required move; a reply
node holds the opponent's defenses; each defense's `then` is the next solve/done. Only defenses
that lead to another move to find are auto-played; a defense straight to `done` is a one-move win.

Moved in from `lucena-backend/grounding_tools` 2026-07-22 (same reasoning as the
poisoned-line detector the same day: drill adjudication is differentiated coaching
logic and pure tree-walking — no DB, no session state — so it lives beside the rest
of the tactical vocabulary; the backend keeps a thin re-export shim). The tree
itself still comes from `lucena_engine.line_tree.build_line_tree`; this module only
WALKS caller-supplied trees — it never builds one.
