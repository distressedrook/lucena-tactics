"""Poisoned-line detection — find the human TRAPS in a position.

Moved in from lucena-engine (2026-07-22): lucena-engine is being kept as
thin, license-neutral infrastructure (board core + UCI/gRPC transport);
differentiated coaching logic belongs in a private repo, and a trap
detector is squarely that — it's just a mechanism the OPPONENT hopes you
walk into, the same vocabulary this repo already builds. Only the imports
changed (this file now depends on `lucena-engine` as an ordinary installed
package, like everything else in `src/`, rather than on its own internal
relative modules).

A line is **poisoned** when a move a player at the student's rating would naturally play (Maia)
walks into a tactic (Stockfish), AND the real joint probability of a human walking that exact
path clears a noise floor — not merely "somewhere in Maia's top-k." Slice 1 (formerly `nuance.py`)
used rank alone as the human-plausibility signal; this slice replaces that with Maia's actual
policy probability, multiplied along the whole path (`poisoned`), because rank conflates a move
played 60% of the time with one played 0.8% of the time.

Two public functions on one primitive:
  - `find_poisoned_lines`      — the mover's own temptations (the defensive read; the live nudge).
  - `find_practical_tries` — my moves that shove the OPPONENT into the most-riddled position (the
                             offensive "Tal move"; built on `find_poisoned_lines`).

Determinism is load-bearing: a detected trap is a reproducible artifact, so search is **node-limited
on a single-threaded engine**, never `movetime` (wall-clock search yields phantom traps — proven on
the Tal set). The caller passes `Engine(threads=1)`.
