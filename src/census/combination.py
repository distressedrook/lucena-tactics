"""combination detector — "there's a forcing win here" (LLD §2.3, multi-move).

The M3 trio and the fork detector are 1–2 ply: they surface *immediate* motifs.
A multi-move combination — a forced mate, or a forcing sequence that wins
decisively — lives past their horizon, in the engine's principal variation. On
those positions the sheet used to lead with a shallow distractor ("the opponent
threatens X") while the actual win sat unmentioned in `lines[0]`.

This detector reads the engine verdict directly and, when the best line is a
**forced mate** or a **forcing decisive shot** (a check or a sound sacrifice that
is clearly better than every alternative), emits one high-salience fact naming
the entry move — so the coach leads with the combination, not the distractor. It
does *not* spell the whole line (the PV/arrow carry that); it flags that a
forcing win exists and where it starts. Being the engine's own verdict, it needs
no reconciliation. Concept: `tactical-signals`.
