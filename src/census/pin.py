"""pin detector — absolute pins (a piece stuck in front of its own king).

Pure board geometry: walk each king's rays; a friendly piece with an aligned
enemy slider behind it is pinned to the king — it cannot move off that line, and
some of its moves (including captures) are *illegal*. This grounds two things the
coach otherwise eyeballs and gets wrong: "your knight is pinned, it can't move",
and "that recapture is illegal — the pawn is pinned" (exactly case-02's `exd5`).

An absolute pin is a fact of geometry, always true, so unlike the salience-hint
detectors it needs no engine reconciliation. Board-core only (GPL hygiene holds).
Concept: `pins-skewers`.
