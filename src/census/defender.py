"""defender-removed detector — the "remove the guard" motif (LLD §2.3).

Static, board-core only. Fires when an enemy piece E that the side to move
already attacks is held up by *exactly one* defender D, and that defender is
itself attackable by the side to move. Removing D leaves E hanging — the
classic "the knight is c6's only defender" fact.

This is deliberately a two-ply *hint*, not a verdict: it says a guard is
removable, not that the whole combination is sound (the engine / SEE decide
that). Concept: `removing-the-defender`.
