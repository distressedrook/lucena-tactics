"""null-move threat detector — the killer Socratic fact (LLD §2.3).

"What if you just passed?" We compare the side-to-move's best reply against what
the *opponent* gets if handed a free move (a null move). The gap is the cost of
passing — i.e. the threat the side to move must answer:

    threat_swing = stm_win% + opp_free_win% - 100

where `stm_win%` is the side-to-move's win% with their best move and
`opp_free_win%` is the opponent's win% after the null move. A large positive
swing means passing is expensive: something is threatened. This isolates a
*threat* from merely *being worse* — a lost position has a high `opp_free_win%`
but so does its real best line, so the gap stays small.

This is the one M3 detector that needs the engine (two analyses: the real
position and the passed one). Search finds threats a single static capture
misses (a fork setup, a mate net, a defender deflected first) and prices them by
win%, not just SEE.

Determinism split: callers pass `nodes=` (tests, reproducible) or
`movetime_ms=` (production), forwarded verbatim to both `Engine.analyse` calls.
The pair is reproducible under the same rules as `Engine.analyse` (fresh engine
or `new_game()` first; nodes + threads=1).
