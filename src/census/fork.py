"""fork / double-attack detector — the "one move, two targets" motif (LLD §2.3).

Static, board-core only. Fires when the side to move has a legal move whose
piece, from its destination, attacks **two or more things worth winning** — two
loose pieces (a queen forking two rooks), or a check plus a loose piece (a royal
knight fork). The defender cannot parry both, so material falls.

This is the motif the M3 trio missed: the fact sheet surfaced only distractors
on the fork positions (case-02 Nd5+, case-03 Qd4) and left the winning double
attack to the coach's unaided vision. It is *deterministic* — pure
`attackers()`/`defenders()` geometry — so grounding it removes that gap.

Like every detector this is a salience *hint*, not a verdict: it flags a
plausible double attack, and `build_fact_sheet` reconciles it against the engine
(a fork the engine rejects — the forking piece is itself lost, or something is
simply better — is dropped, the §2.3 rule *a SEE fact that contradicts the
engine loses*). Board-only, it is best-effort. Concept: `forks-double-attack`.
