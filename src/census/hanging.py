"""hanging-piece detector — SEE-based, board-core only (LLD §2.3).

A piece is *hanging* when the opposite side has a capture that wins material by
static exchange (SEE > 0). We report both directions:

- **opportunities**: enemy pieces the side to move can win now — enumerated
  directly from the side-to-move's legal captures.
- **dangers**: the side-to-move's own pieces the opponent can win — surfaced by
  passing (`null_move`) and reading the opponent's legal captures. This is the
  static, engine-free floor under the null-move *threat* probe (`null_move.py`),
  which adds real search on top.

The material verdict is SEE, never a piece-value table; `PIECE_CP` here only
shapes salience and the human sentence. Concept: `hanging-pieces`.
