"""The fact sheet — deterministic salience extraction (LLD-analysis §2.3).

Every engine-tool response is built from a fact sheet, never a bare position.
This module owns the `Fact` record and `build_fact_sheet`, which runs the M3
detector trio, ranks the raw facts by salience, assigns stable `F#` ids, and
truncates to the top five.

Detectors are *hints ranked by salience, never verdicts* — the material
verdict is always SEE / the engine, never these facts. Salience weights are
hand-tuned in v1 (LLD OQ#8); the formulas live in each detector and are pinned
in `docs/contracts/M3-facts.md`.

`Fact` is defined here (not in the detectors package) so the detectors import
it without a cycle: `build_fact_sheet` imports the detector functions lazily.
