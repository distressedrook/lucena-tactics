"""Forcing-line TREE builder — the "only move" tree.

A *forcing line* is any position that takes the puzzle form: **exactly one** legal
move preserves the result — win OR draw — and every other move is *catastrophically
worse*, meaning it drops out of the result band. The band's floor is set by the best
move: a WINNING best must be kept winning (>= WIN_BAR, exactly today's behavior), a
HOLDING best kept at least drawn (>= HOLDABLE_FLOOR); a LOST best is no puzzle. Exactly
one move at/above that floor is the only-move. This subsumes both winning combinations
("only move to keep the win") and defensive holds ("only move to hold the draw"), and a
mate is just a maximally-winning only-move. The tree drills those only-move moments and
branches on **all** the opponent's real defenses (a node can have many children — play
through them all), continuing until the result is banked (many moves hold it) or mate.

Two-tier depth for latency vs trust: a cheap shallow pass over EVERY legal move
(`discover`) decides whether exactly one wins. When that verdict is *unambiguous*
(the only winner clears the bar by a margin and the runner-up is well under), we
trust it; only a *borderline* node pays the deeper `verify` pass. Serial by
design — the tree is a mostly-sequential main line, so thread/engine-pool
parallelism measured *slower* here (GIL-serialised engine reads + near-zero
parallel width); the real latency win is not re-searching when the shallow pass
already decided (see learnings.md #13). Deterministic: `nodes`-limited searches
and a fixed traversal order.
