"""Puzzle solution TREE builder — engine-computed (not a single scripted line).

chess.com/Lichess puzzles play ONE opponent reply — the move the game happened
to feature — so you only ever refute one defense and can "solve" a tactic you
don't actually understand. This builds the whole tree instead: at each of *your*
turns there must be a single clearly-best move (the "only move"); at each
*opponent* turn we enumerate every reasonable defense (within a win% band of
their best), and you must solve them all. The engine is what makes this possible;
it's the rigor the grounded architecture buys us over the big sites.

Board-core + engine only (GPL hygiene holds). Local Stockfish, so the extra
tree search is metered-free (frugality governs Claude tokens, not compute).
