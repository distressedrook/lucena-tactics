"""End-to-end poisoned-line detection over the REAL chain: real Stockfish +
the real policy-emitting Maia wrapper. This is the test the fake-based suite
(test_poisoned_line_detector.py) structurally cannot be — it injects fakes that
always supply `policy`, so it never notices when the production Maia wiring drops
it (the "green tests, dead in prod" bug this file guards against).

Slow + needs both binaries. The oracle is the contract's worked example
(docs/contracts/M-poisoned-line-detector.md "Worked example").
