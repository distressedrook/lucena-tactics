"""Serialize→restore must keep the move LINE coherent across a backtrack.

The walker's line is not in `to_state()` (its home is the session history), so `restore` needs the
line passed in. Without it the line defaulted to just [root]; the NEXT move landed at ply 1 and a
sibling-defence backtrack truncated the wrong prefix — the recorded history came out scrambled and
the board "went to weird states". This pins the fix (strategies pass `history` → `restore(line=…)`).
