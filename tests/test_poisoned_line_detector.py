"""Black-box tests for lucena_engine.poisoned_line_detector
(contract: docs/contracts/M-poisoned-line-detector.md).

Written from the contract ONLY. Nothing under python/lucena/mcp/ matching
*poisoned_line_detector*, python/lucena/mcp/nuance.py, or tests/unit/test_nuance.py
was read, opened, grepped, or run to discover an expected value. The module this
file imports does not exist yet at this path (M-poisoned-line-detector is not
implemented) -- these tests encode the promised public shape and are NOT expected
to pass yet. That's the point of contract-first testing (TESTING-WORKFLOW.md):
tests define correctness before the code exists, so a real implementation is
built against them, not the other way around.

`engine` and `maia` are fully faked (duck-typed per the contract's "Dependencies
the caller injects" section) -- no real Stockfish, no real Maia subprocess.
`Line`/`Analysis`/`Score` are the REAL dataclasses from lucena_engine (the
contract explicitly types Analysis.best.score / Analysis.lines[i].score as
lucena_engine.evalmodel.Score), so FakeEngine builds real Line/Analysis objects;
only the *engine itself* -- the process, the search -- is faked.

Every FEN/UCI-legality claim below was independently verified with python-chess
in scratch (never imported here -- GPL hygiene, CLAUDE.md: python-chess may only
be imported under tools/ and tests/, and this file doesn't need it at import
time since every position is hardcoded and pre-verified). Move-sequence comments
document that verification.

Numeric expectations for win%/spike are computed from the SAME win_pct(cp)
formula the M2 contract already documents and lucena_engine exports (reused here
via win_pct, exactly as test_evalmodel.py does), not hand-derived, so exact
approx() anchors are reproducible:
    win_pct(800)  ~ 95.0058   win_pct(100) ~ 59.1026   spike(800,100) ~ 35.90
    win_pct(20)   ~ 51.8402   win_pct(0)   = 50.0
    win_pct(250)  ~ 71.5148   win_pct(-1000, i.e. 100-95.0058 style) ~ 4.9942

Sections:
  * fakes         -- FakeEngine / FakeMaia, fen-keyed, raise loudly on an
                     unmapped fen so an unexpected internal query is visible.
  * find_poisoned_lines -- shape, tiers/boundaries, dedup, ordering, edge cases.
  * find_practical_tries -- shape, floor_cp exclusion, trap_count.
  * worked example -- the contract's own integration oracle, skipped (needs a
                     real engine + a policy-emitting Maia, out of scope here).
